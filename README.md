# MDMRI-pTau

This project aims to develop a non-invasive, interpretable diagnostic approach for Alzheimer’s disease using **Multidimensional MRI (MD-MRI)**. Specifically, we investigate the relationship between voxelwise joint probability distributions of **T1, T2, and Mean Diffusivity (T1D/T2D distributions)** and the concentration of **hyperphosphorylated tau protein (pTau)** in brain tissue.
